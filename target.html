        <h2>Target Audience?</h2>
        <p>
            Have you ever seen a product, service, or marketing ad and thought, "Who in the world is this for?" We've all seen marketing campaigns that have fallen flat because they didn't connect with their target audience, or it was unclear who the target audience was.

            Understanding target audiences is key to the success of any marketing campaign because consumers will feel as if they connect with your brand. If you're unsure how to find your target audience, here's what you need to know.

            They are also used to define the buyer persona of a business, as well. Buyer personas are a representative overview of a business's ideal customer drawn from data that makes up a target audience. Some of these demographics and behavior areas are:

            Location
            Age
            Gender
            Employment
            Income
            This information helps understand the customer and how they make purchase decisions. Targeting a specific audience will help your campaigns reach the correct people who will relate most to your company's message and products.

            Always make sure to understand the difference between target audience and target market. While similar, their difference is critical for marketers.

            <h3>Target Market vs. Target Audience</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            Both target audience and target markets are centered around segmenting customers into groups to make informed business decisions; however, a target market is a specific group of consumers a companyâ€™s products target. A target audience defines that group using audience demographics, interests, and buying history.
