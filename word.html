        <h3>What is a WordPress pingback?</h3>
        <p>
            A WordPress pingback is a notification that WordPress sends to other WordPress blogs when linking to their content. This notification shows up in the WordPress comments section of the post that was linked to. On other words, it’s WordPress’s version of a trackback.

            In a way, you can think of pingbacks like @ mentions or tags on social media — they let the other WordPress blog know that you mentioned them in your own blog post (and vice versa).

            Here's an example of what a WordPress pingback looks like when it shows up in the comment moderation area of your dashboard:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="word.jpeg" alt="" class="container-fluid" id="imga">
        <p>
            The exact design of the pingback will depend on the WordPress theme you're using. Some themes only display the URL of the post (as you see in the example above), while other themes will also show a short excerpt of the portion of the text that includes the link to your post.

            Pingbacks can also happen within your own site — they aren't limited to separate WordPress blogs.

            For example, if you write a blog post that links to another blog post on your site via internal linking, WordPress will send a pingback to that other post by default (though you can disable this if you find it annoying).
